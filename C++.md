Overview	 	 	
C++ language is a superset of the ‘C’ language and was initially known as “C with Classes”. In "C" operator ++ is used to increment the value by 1. That means to the language ‘C’, developers have added some extra features and hence named as C++. C++ is a general purpose programming language and supports object oriented programming features.
